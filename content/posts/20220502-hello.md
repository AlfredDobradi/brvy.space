This is my new blog. I nuked and reinstalled my dedicated server today so I have absolutely nothing running, except this.

Trying to do things right now and use Ansible for most things, we'll see how long that lasts. I'm also planning to set a new Mastodon instance up, but that's it so far. Anyhoops, see y'alls.
